Baker:Hello, Donald! Craving a donut? Watch for Regina. She's a glutton.
Fisherman:Hey, Donald! How's the donut quest? Be careful of Regina. She's a nuisance.
Librarian:Hi, Donald! Looking for a book? Perhaps about donuts or seagulls? Quiet, please. Don't let Regina in. She's noisy and chaotic.
Florist:Greetings, Donald! Lovely day, right? Fancy flowers? They smell nicer than donuts. But hide them from Regina. She likes to spoil them.
