You're no match for me, you landlubber!
Squawk! You just got schooled by a seagull!
Better luck next time, matey. Oh wait, there won't be a next time!
You thought you could find the treasure? Ha! You're just a featherless fool!
Regina rules the skies and the seas! You're just a pathetic pirate wannabe!
You should have stayed on dry land, you scurvy dog!
You'll never get past me, you salty sea slug!
You just met your doom, courtesy of Regina, the queen of the gulls!
